**Aim:**
* Masking/colouring is a preparatory function used to identify specific features of interest on a fired cartridge image like the Breech face and Firing pin impression. These features can be used to determine if a fired cartridge came from same or different fire arms.
  
* Goal of the project is to automatically mask fired cartridge images using machine learning techniques.

**Steps taken:**
* Main libraries used for the project are cv2, sklearn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

* There are two parts to the project - Part 1: Breech-face Identification & Part 2: Firing pin and drag Identification.

* Masking is done using OTSU image segmentation, HDBSCAN clustering algorithm and Hough Circle Transform methods.

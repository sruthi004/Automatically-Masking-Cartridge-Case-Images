* Masking/colouring is a preparatory function used to identify specific features of interest on a fired cartridge image like the Breech face and Firing pin impression. These features can be used to determine if a fired cartridge came from same or different fire arms.
  
* Goal of the project is to automatically mask fired cartridge images using machine learning techniques.
